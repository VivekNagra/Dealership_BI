BUSINESS CASE:

In this assignment, we imagine ourselves as a group wanting to open a car dealership. In this context, we need insights into the car market to ensure the best possible start in the industry. We aim to understand if there are specific car brands that sell the most, if we should consider geographical location regarding potential growth and competition, and if there are specific target demographics for certain types of cars (e.g., affluent men driving luxury cars, women driving compact cars, etc.).

Purpose:

The purpose of this study is for us, as a potential newly established car dealership, to understand the market we are entering to give ourselves the best possible chance of success. Additionally, the study will likely provide us with a better understanding and ideas for marketing strategies, as well as an insight into which regions would be most suitable for our dealership.

Research Questions:

What are the current trends and preferences in the car market?
Which factors are most important for car buyers? Is it price, brand, or are there other factors that play a significant role in customers' purchasing decisions?
Which regions have the greatest potential?
How does customers' annual income influence their choice of car class and price range?
How do sales trends vary throughout the year, and is there a peak season for car sales?

Hypotheses:

Null Hypothesis: There is no significant correlation between car features, brand reputation, and purchasing preferences.
Null Hypothesis: Buyers' attitudes towards car brands are uniform.
Null Hypothesis: Sales trends remain consistent throughout the year without significant seasonal variations.
Null Hypothesis: Customers' preferences for newer or older car models are independent of their demographic characteristics.
